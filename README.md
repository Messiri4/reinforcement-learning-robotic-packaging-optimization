# Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Packaging Optimization

This project simulates a robotic packaging environment using PyBullet, focusing on developing and evaluating reinforcement learning (RL) strategies for robotic manipulation tasks. The simulation features a Franka Panda robotic arm performing object manipulation tasks, including picking and placing objects on a tray. The goal is to establish a foundation for RL-based control in the future.

## 🧠 Project Overview

- **Simulation Environment**:Utilizes PyBullet to create a realistic physics-based simulation of a robotic packaging scenario
- **Robotic Arm**:Incorporates the Franka Panda robotic arm for executing pick-and-place tasks

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

 Python 3x
 PyBullt
 Numy

### Installation Steps

1 Clone the repositor:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Messiri4/reinforcement-learning-robotic-packaging-optimization.git
   cd reinforcement-learning-robotic-packaging-optimization
   ``


2 Install the required Python package:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ``


## 🚀 Running the Simulation

To start the simulation


```bash
python main.py
``


This will launch the PyBullet simulation environment with the Franka Panda robotic arm ready for interactin.

## 🧪 Testing the Environment

To run the test cases and validate the environmen:


```bash
python test_env.py
``


This script will execute predefined tests to ensure the environment's components are functioning as expeced.
